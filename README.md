I am Prasanna Venkatesh S, a recent B.Tech graduate in Electronics and Communication (ECE) Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology with a strong passion for Digital Design, RTL, and Computer Architecture. 
During my undergraduate, I have explored each sub-domains of ECE through research projects and internships and I found myself most interested in VLSI and Computer Architecture. I believe in building things from scratch and learning by doing â€” which aligns with the high-impact culture at Synopsys.

## ðŸš€ Why Iâ€™m a Good Fit

**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

1. - In the initial two years of my B.Tech ECE at VIT, I focused on RF communication and high-frequency hardware integration, where I conducted extensive research on â€˜Miniaturized Implantable Antennasâ€™ to address the growing need for affordable and efficient health monitoring systems.
   - I designed a novel **2.4 GHz implantable antenna aimed for biotelemetry applications** simulated its performance, fabricated the design, and successfully tested it in an anechoic chamber. This research was both technically challenging and rewarding, culminating in a research paper that I have submitted for publication.

2. - Later, my focus shifted towards VLSI and semiconductor design, where I conducted research in '_**In-Memory Computing (IMC) Architecture using 8T SRAM Array for AI Applications**_' , which aims to enhance computational efficiency by reducing latency and energy use.
   - I developed a novel 8T SRAM cell array architecture enabling in-memory logic operations, designed a 256-bit SRAM array in _Cadence Virtuoso_, and created innovative sensing schemes (Skewed Inverter and Multi-Logic SA), validated under PVT and Monte Carlo simulations.

I have authored **four research papers** (three under review), including one on this work, showcasing my consistency in contributing to cutting-edge research. My  ability to take a design from concept to tape-out-ready verificationâ€”combining strong technical skills with methodical problem-solvingâ€”makes me an ideal candidate for your VLSI R&D team, where I can contribute meaningfully from day one.

**ACADEMIC PROJECTS** 

1. **RISC-V RV32I Processor** Implementation:
- Designed a robust **32-bit RISC-V processor** with a strong focus on architectural efficiency, instruction throughput, and timing closure. Implemented an optimized 3-stage pipelined architecture (Fetchâ€“Decodeâ€“Execute) for RV32I ISA using Verilog HDL, ensuring smooth instruction flow.
- Developed the complete top-level schematic, integrated all modules, and synthesized the design using Intel Quartus Prime. Successfully verified  major RISC-V instruction categories (arithmetic, load/store, and immediate ETC) using extensive testbench, demonstrating both functional correctness and high simulation coverage. This project reflects my hands-on expertise in CPU microarchitecture, pipeline design, hazard mitigation, and hardware verification methodologies.

2. **Design and Analysis of High-performance MAC unit** :

- Developed multiple high-performance MAC architectures in Verilog HDL, integrating _Vedic, Dadda, and Wallace multipliers_ with _Kogge-Stone and Brent-Kung adders_ . Designed scalable datapaths for 4-, 8-, and 16-bit configurations and synthesized on Intel Cyclone V FPGA. 
- Performed comprehensive PPA (Performance, Power, Area) analysis to evaluate trade-offs and identify the most optimal architecture. This project highlights strong expertise in Verilog RTL design, FPGA-based implementation, digital architecture optimization, and Computer Architecture principles.

3. **APB Communication Protocol Design** (_Ongoing Project_) :

- Currently developing an AMBA APB-based communication system, implementing a master interface connected to three slave peripherals â€“ Memory Register, GPIO, and UART modules. Designed Verilog RTL for masterâ€“slave handshaking, address decoding, and peripheral interfacing. 
- Integrated UART for full-duplex TX/RX communication and verified functionality through simulation. This project demonstrates strong skills in digital protocol design, peripheral integration, and SoC subsystem development.
